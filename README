cerebellar granule cells can faithfully transmit modulated firing rate
signals. Front. Cell. Neurosci. 8:304. doi: 10.3389/fncel.2014.00304

The Model of the Granule cell used is from: Solinas S., Nieus T,

Granular Layer Predicts Circuit Spatio-Temporal Filtering
Properties. Front Cell Neurosci. 2010;4:12.

1. run ./nrncompule to compile .mod files

2. To run the simulations and plot the figures execute the commands
below.

3. Figures will be saved to: figs/Pub

Notes:
- When running simulations with MPI the number of nodes has to be <=
  to number of cells, otherwise error is returned.
